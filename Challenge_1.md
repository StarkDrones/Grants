## Problem Statement
Our organization have been working on exploring a wide variety of technologies, both theoretical and existing. This includes everything from exploring Quantum Origin through a variety of derived theorems to building water harvesting devices for third world countries and working on a decentralized internet. In the vast exploration of STEM, there are certain limitations and constraints in regards to time. In regards to engineering challenges, there are three that we have lesser time to explore that I believe are worth tackling. These three challenges are centered around solving the world's energy crisis, solving the world's resources problem, and reaching new heights in space exploration lesser explored. The three problems we are looking at, which is described by the below three tracks are centered around black hole energy extraction, oceanic colonization, and even extraterrestrial communication. All projects submitted with be under the [open innovation license](https://github.com/StarkDrones/OIN/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
