## 1: Energy Extraction from Black Holes
Currently, one of the biggest problems in relation to energy sustainability is harnessing the power of nuclear fusion. However, what would take this even one step further? What engineering challenge if solved, may provide an abundant source of seemingly limitless energy? When looking at the Penrose process, it has theoretically been proven as possible through [experimentation](https://www.sciencealert.com/an-experiment-has-just-demonstrated-how-energy-could-be-extracted-from-a-black-hole). For the past many years myself, I have been wondering what would happen if we could extract energy from black holes, and where we as a civilization could be? If the [closest black hole](https://astronomy.com/news/2020/07/what-would-happen-if-you-fell-into-a-black-hole) may be a daunting 1000 light years away, and the closest known super massive blackhole may be 25,000 light years away, [Sagittarius A](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/05/11/how-close-to-earth-is-the-closest-black-hole/?sh=27b79db6e9f9), how do we get to where we need to go? The fastest answer to solve this outside of accelerated aeronautical development, is the experimentation of self contained microscopic blackholes. The question is, what type of technology needs to be possible to figure out the right equations? Is it a new algorithm, hardware, etc. and how do we go about conceptualizing such things beyond where ANY PHYSICIST has gone before? This proposes one of the biggest engineering challenges of all time.

## 2: Oceanic Colonization: Smart Underwater Tech
Stark Drones has some [underwater wireless networking and telemetry](https://www.oceancolonization.com/) solutions. However, they want to take this a step further. A challenge in regards to the environment and our limited allocation of resources, is how do we make the best of what we have? The ocean is perhaps one of our more abundant resources in the foreseeable future. Not only is harnessing the full power of our ocean likely important for this civilization, but these same types of technologies may be used when we colonize other planets later on. The question is whether underwater tunnels, smart elevators, artificial land, or submarine cities, what will the solution be? Can it garnish hydroelectric sources, or what external source will power it? How can we make sure it doesn't negatively impact the environment or marine life? What makes said solution worth exploring? Many big questions can be tackled with this challenge.

## 3: Astronomic Radiosonic Analysis and Transcription Pipelines
Have you wondered what is going on in outerspace? It seems like a dull question to ask, obviously most people have. Many people have contemplated that we aren't the only intelligent planetary species in this universe. The idea of other terrestrial beings seem more and more likely. With programs such as the [SETI Institute](https://www.seti.org/) which I have been a fan of for many years, or programs like [Zooniverse]((https://www.zooniverse.org/)) and the [CHIME Experiment](https://chime-experiment.ca/en), we are exploring lots of uncharted territory. Outside of the area of data compression, there are uncovered areas in terms of building full fledgling algorithms, linguistic and communications-wise for translating large radio frequencies and even transcribing possible alien communications. There are organizations like [CETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_extraterrestrial_intelligence) and projects like [CosmicOS](https://cosmicos.github.io/)  trying to tackle this problem. How can you translate messages from radiosonic signals to bits and binary then to fully spoken words? How fast can you speed up the process? Going beyond trying to capture one word sentiments like "hello" or "what", if one is able to capture full fledged words and maybe even sentences in real time, this would lead to huge breakthroughs. Excuse my mad scientist fantasy, but what if communicating with aliens is feasible, and how can we design a linguistic, hardware, or transcribing system that puts us a step closer?
