## 1: Energy Extraction from Black Holes
Currently, one of the biggest problems in relation to energy sustainability is harnessing the power of nuclear fusion. However, what would take this even one step further? What engineering challenge if solved, may provide an abundant source of seemingly limitless energy? When looking at the Penrose process, it has theoretically been proven as possible through [experimentation](https://www.sciencealert.com/an-experiment-has-just-demonstrated-how-energy-could-be-extracted-from-a-black-hole). For the past many years myself, I have been wondering what would happen if we could extract energy from black holes, and where we as a civiliation could be? If the [closest black hole](https://astronomy.com/news/2020/07/what-would-happen-if-you-fell-into-a-black-hole) may be a daunting 1000 light years away, and the closest known super massive blackhole may be 25,000 light years away, [Sagittarius A](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/05/11/how-close-to-earth-is-the-closest-black-hole/?sh=27b79db6e9f9), how do we get to where we need to go? The fastest answer to solve this outside of accelerated aeronautical development, is the experimentaiton of self contained microscopic blackholes. The question is, what type of technology needs to be possible to figure out the right equations? Is it a new algorithm, hardware, etc. and how do we go about conceptualizing such things beyond where ANY PHYSICIST has gone before? This proposes one of the biggest engineering challenges of all time.
