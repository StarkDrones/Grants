# Grants and Crowdsourced Challenge Proposals
This is a series of grants, crowdsourced and project proposals in relation to promoting open innovation. [Stark Drones](https://www.starkdrones.org) is heavily committed to the promotion of open innovation and an open internet. We know that well developed technology should be at the benefit of humanity. We also think that there are many standards that should push us forward in terms of aspiring for the stars. "Me to" products and people having an outdated mentality when it comes to venture capital, innovation, or moving forward isn't what our future should aspire for.
