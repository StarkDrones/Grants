# Grants and Crowdsourced Challenge Proposals
This is a series of grants, crowdsourced and project proposals in relation to promoting open innovation. [Stark Drones](https://www.starkdrones.org) is heavily committed to the promotion of open innovation and an open internet. We know that well developed technology should be at the benefit of humanity. We also think that there are many standards that should push us forward in terms of aspiring for the stars. *"Me to"* products and people having an outdated mentality when it comes to venture capital, innovation, or moving forward isn't what our future should aspire for.

##### Please keep in mind submitting doesn't guarantee acceptance or a prize. We have the right to reject submissions, and not award or respond to what we deem fit. We also don't guarantee that we will not decide to try tackling some of these innovation challenges later on. This is especially true if given no valid submissions. All projects submitted here are of the context of the [open innovation license](https://github.com/StarkDrones/OIN). Outside of the license, the maker and submitter retains all rights to their intellectual property.
